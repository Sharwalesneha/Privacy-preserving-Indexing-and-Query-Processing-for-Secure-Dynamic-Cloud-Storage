With the increasing popularity of cloud-based data services, data owners are highly motivated to store their huge amount of potentially sensitive personal data files on remote servers in encrypted form.
Clients later can query over the encrypted database to retrieve files while protecting privacy of both the queries and the database, by allowing some reasonable leakage information. 
 Meanwhile, recent literature has shown that most dynamic SSE solutions leaking information on updated keywords are vulnerable to devastating file-injection attacks. 
The only way to thwart these attacks is to design forward-private schemes. 
investigated new privacy-preserving indexing and query processing protocols which meet a number of desirable properties, including the multi-keyword query processing with conjunction and disjunction logic queries,
practically high privacy guarantees with adaptive chosen keyword attack (CKA2) security and forward privacy, and the support of dynamic data operations, etc. 
we introduced a suite of new and novel SSE index designs for processing queries over large-scale encrypted databases. 
Our index constructions made trade-offs between query efficiency and query privacy, with flexible and comprehensive query functionalities. 
Through rigorous security analysis under strong security model and extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrated the effectiveness and practicality of our constructions.
